What we created this time is a Climate Clock customized with new features.

The Climate Clock displays the remaining time until the Earth reaches its limit due to global warming. 
Currently, it is believed that if the Earth's average temperature rises by 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels (around the 18th century), the negative impacts of climate change will become irreversible. 
This remaining time is calculated by a team of researchers from Germany. 
The clock is installed in several major cities worldwide, where it can easily catch people's attention, to raise awareness of the urgency of global warming and its time limit.
With this project, we aimed to address global warming as a personal issue, share the crisis with those around us, and encourage actions that can be taken in daily life.


Our project automatically retrieves and calculates the latest data and displays it on an LED panel embedded in a magic mirror. The data includes:

Information from Climate Clock:
- The remaining time indicated by the Climate Clock, which shows the time left to keep the Earth's average temperature rise below 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels
- The global renewable energy usage rate

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA):
- The total CO2 emissions from energy consumption in the U.S. (monthly data) and year-on-year reduction rates for the same month
- CO2 emissions from energy consumption in the U.S. residential sector (monthly data) and year-on-year reduction rates for the same month
- The total CO2 emissions from energy consumption in Massachusetts (annual data) and year-on-year reduction rates

By sharing this information, we hope to increase awareness of global warming and inspire actions to combat it.
